Because the API uses regular URLs, GET requests (but not other operations) can be made simply by typing the URL into the browser. Since GET requests return an HTML representation of the resource by default, the user will see an HTML page with the requested resources. If the resource has its permissions set to `public`, the text/html response allows users to share a visual representation of a resource using the static link for that resource. If its permissions are set to `private`, only authorized users will be able to view the HTML page. Unauthorized users will simply see an error message if they try to open the link. For requests to a collection, a summary of the DLx resources in that collection will be returned. For requests for multiple resources, a list of links to the individual resources will be returned.
