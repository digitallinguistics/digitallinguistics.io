Here's a common frustration in linguistics: You try to search for a string of text with a few diacritics in a document or a corpus — maybe just a tone mark here or a retracted vowel there, no big deal. You remember seeing the word before, so you expect find results, and then… nothing. No results. You skim the document until you find the text you're looking for, copy-paste that into the search, and suddenly everything works fine. What gives!?
